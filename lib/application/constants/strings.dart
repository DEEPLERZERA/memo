// This is a temporary constants file related to all strings
//
// Even if the v1 for memo will only be available in ptBR, splitting random strings throughout the code will make it
// hard when we decide to support multiple locales.
//
// Also, when new locales are added to the application, we can still maintain a single point of entry for all strings
// just like this file, but we have to consider that we will possibly need access to the BuildContext, as this is where
// the runtime locale is determined.
